# House Price Prediction
## Introduction
The project is regarding the prediction of house prices using Machine Learning Algorithms in Python. The project includes Data cleaning, Pre-processing, Feature engineering, EDA, Model development, and evaluation.

## Data
The Data has been extracted from [MagicBricks](https://www.magicbricks.com/) (a website, that provides a common platform to property buyers and sellers).
Data contains various features which impact the price of a house some of them are Area, BHK, Parking space, etc.

## ML Algorithms used
* Linear Regression
* Lasso Regression
* Elastic Net
* Decision Tree Regressor
* Random Forest Regressor
* Gradient Boosting
